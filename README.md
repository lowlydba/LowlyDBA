# John McCall — Staff Site Reliability Engineer

Humanism through technology.

I build systems that do not implode. I mentor humans to do the same. I value humility, clarity, and evidence over hierarchy, ego, and process for its own sake. I am primarily concerned with problems that impact people, not just systems.

## Philosophy

Engineering is not just shipping features. It is thinking critically about *what we build*, *why we build it*, and *how it impacts people*. As a neurodivergent engineer, I know first hand how systems can exclude people. I strive to build inclusive systems that empower all people, regardless of ability or background.

I [write about][substack] the invisible forces in tech: how gate-keeping limits opportunity, how thoughtful design scales teams, and how human-centered thinking improves systems and lives.
